Need to be implemented:
General:
- list of zones
AGENT:
- list (or array) of needs
- function to determine it's current target (based on need functions)
- list (or array) of needs that are met by this agent (since Zones are agents)
- functions for incementing each need the agent meets

Need to implement a "Need" class:
Each "need" object has:
- name
- decrement function
- "Threshold value" (value where the actor has to begin searching for a zone that meets this need)
- current value
