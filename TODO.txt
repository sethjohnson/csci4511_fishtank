Thoughts: Do we really need zones and agents to share inheritence? Can zones just be zones and agents just be agents? If needed, we can easily give agents a list of "target" agents in addition to a list of zones... 


Need to be implemented:
General:
- list of zones (Done - Seth)
- Clean up unneeded inheritence hierarchy (maybe?)

AGENT:
- list (or array) of needs (Done- Seth)
- function to determine it's current target (based on need functions)
- list (or array) of needs that are met by this agent[zone?] (since Zones are agents)
- functions for incementing each need the agent meets (Seth thinks this should just be a value in the link between needs and zones). 

Need to implement a "Need" class: (Done - conrad)
Each "need" object has:
- name (Done - conrad)
- decrement function (Note: I don't know how to pass in a math function, all it does is subtract 1 right now -conrad)
- "Threshold value" (value where the actor has to begin searching for a zone that meets this need) (Done - conrad)
- current value (Done - conrad)
